# Your Logical Fallacy Is

This repository includes the Turkish translation of [yourlogicalfallacyis.com](https://yourlogicalfallacyis.com), which is a website dedicated to explaining common flaws in reasoning:

> Logical fallacies are like tricks or illusions of thought, and they're often very sneakily used by politicians and the media to fool people. Don't be fooled! This website has been designed to help you identify and call out dodgy logic wherever it may raise its ugly, incoherent head.

All credit for the translation goes to the fine people at [Özgür Düşünce Hareketi](http://ozgurdusuncehareketi.org) *(Freethought Movement)*. I simply made some slight changes to the translation, applied the latest design to the website and improved upon it for increased readability. Note that the backend is different than the English version and it lacks some functionalities such as the store.
